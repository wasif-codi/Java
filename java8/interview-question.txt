Q5- Employee class with field id name and age sort the employee class based on names using stream
								
Q6- Write a method that takes an integer array and an integer target, and returns a pair of indices (as an int[]) 										
	where the elements at those indices sum to the target.										
	For example, if the array is [2, 7, 11, 15] and the target is 9, the method should return [0, 1] 										
	since the elements at indices 0 and 1 (2 and 7) sum to 9. 										
	Solve this in JAVA 8 where  Array is [10, 11, 23, 27, 32, 37] and target is 33.
