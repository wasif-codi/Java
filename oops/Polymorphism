Polymorphism
............
👉 Poly = many, morph = forms
Polymorphism means one method name having different behaviors depending on the object or input.
Polymorphism allows the same method to perform different actions based on the object or parameters.
There are two types of polymorphism

Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
Same method name, different signature if arguments are same then order should be diffrent.

example....
==========
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
* Decided at compile time
so during compile time only compiler get to know which method to map on method invokation

Run Time polymorphism - method overriding
