Encapsulation
============
is the OOPS concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to data by using access modifiers.

👉 Data is accessed only through methods, not directly.

Data hiding 
===========
Data hiding means preventing direct access to data by making variables private.
